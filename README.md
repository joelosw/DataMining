# DataMining

Just a small repo to implement some Data Mining Algoritmhs (mostly in Python). 
Mainly meant for my personal learning, but feel free to commit any comments or suggestions!

**Implemented:**
* ChiMerge - Discreticing Data Tuples based on Chi-Squared Tests
            Currently only supporting one merge at eacht iteration (even if there are multiple minimum Chi2-values)

**In Progress:**
* Apriori Algorithm - to identify strong Associations - started, pruning seems to destroy some frequent itemsets!

**To be implemented**

* Decision Tree Creation - self explaining
